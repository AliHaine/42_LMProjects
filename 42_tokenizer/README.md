# Tokenizer

This project will teach about tokens and blockchain, student will have to create a unique asset through a blockchain network. Keep in mind that this is a student project and is not intended to be deployed in a 'real' network or used for economic exchange. It will be tested on a test network with fake cypto ( for example Sepolia).

## 42 Word

The global idea of my project is the ability to acquire words. Essentially, a user will be able to claim ownership of a word, making it their exclusive possession.

## Blockchain network

For my project, i chose to use Ethereum as the blockchain. It is simple to use and one of the most used blockchain. Ethereum allows the creation of smart contract and custom tokens.

## Token type

I used the ERC-721 standard due to its ability to create unique tokens for a unique assets. So in my project, each word will have a unique token.
