# Tokenizart

This project will teach about tokens and blockchain, student will have to create a unique asset through a blockchain network. Keep in mind that this is a student project and is not intended to be deployed in a 'real' network or used for economic exchange. It will be tested on a test network with fake cypto ( for example Sepolia).

## 42 Scamft

To create my own NFT, I have created a contract named Scamft. I used RemixIde to code compile and deploy my contract, my contract address is: 0xd2F3403e85Ca936bFf7ca7B79Ec09952D8944E12

## Blockchain network

For my project, i chose to use Ethereum as the blockchain. It is simple to use and one of the most used blockchain. Ethereum allows the creation of smart contract and custom tokens.

## Token type

I used the ERC-721 standard due to its ability to create unique tokens for a unique assets. So in my project, I will be able to create a unique token for each unique NFT.

## Data

The data and images will be stored in IPFS, I have upload my assets using Filebase for more simplicity.
